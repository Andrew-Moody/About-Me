# Hello, I’m Andrew

My background is mechanical engineering and I am currently finishing up my masters at Texas A&M University, “Gig ‘em!”.

In my spare time, I am on a journey to become a software developer with a keen interest in creating video games. I have been actively learning C++ and game development by taking online courses, reading books, and creating my own projects. I started this page to document my progress as I create my final project for Harvard’s CS50x online class. The project is a free for all do anything you want style assignment, so of course I decided to make a game engine! 
The project is still early in development, but I will be updating and adding new features regularly as time permits.
